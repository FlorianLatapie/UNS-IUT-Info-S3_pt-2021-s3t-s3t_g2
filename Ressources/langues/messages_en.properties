texte.pourQui=Zombies is a scramble game for 3 to 6 players, from 14 years old. A game lasts about 60 minutes
texte.histoire=A mysterious scientific experiment allowed the dead to rise up to devour the living. Little by little, all signs of civilization disappeared as the main state organisms closed their doors. The police and army are overwhelmed and cannot contain the looters and marauding criminals. Society is on the brink of collapse and the few survivors have taken refuge in a shopping mall to resist the ever-increasing number of flesh-eating undead. You are one of the last living human beings on Earth and you will do everything you can to get out of this bad patch.
texte.but=Purpose of the game
texte.butExplication=Each player controls 3 characters (4 in a 3-player game) that he will try to keep alive during the zombie attack, while waiting for help to arrive. The one who will keep the most of his characters alive throughout the game will get the upper hand. To do this, you will have to pit your opponents against each other and make sure that their characters are eaten, while you will get away without a bite!	
texte.finDePartie=All the characters still alive are present in one and the same place (except the parking lot (place number 4)).	
texte.FDPsit1=All the characters still alive are present in one and the same place (except the parking lot (place number 4)).	
texte.FDPsit2=There are only 4 living characters left. In a 6-player game, the game ends as soon as there are only 6 characters left alive.
texte.FDPfin=An army helicopter then arrives to rescue the survivors. Each character still alive earns as many points as their value. The player with the most points wins the game. In case of a tie, the player with the most cards in hand is the winner.
